This was basically a bare bones back to basics project as part of the Meta Front End Developer certificate. 
Shows some basic CSS skills.
The project was being peer reviewed so I really didn't need to do my regular check like validator, linting, etc., 
It ticks all the boxes but was mostly a time sensitive project.
